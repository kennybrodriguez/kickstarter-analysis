#An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns

##Overview

Analysis on kickstarter data was done to show how successful theatre kickstarters were and also to show how successful plays were in their funding goals. This was done to help identify trends amongst theatre, and more specifically play, kickstarters. This analysis ultimately showed which months were the most successful to launch in and also which funding goals were the most likely to be successful. This would be useful data to any upcoming theatre production planning.


##Analysis and Challenges

Analysis on kickstarter data was performed to identify trends amongst kickstarters, their launch dates, and their funding goals. This was first done by filtering kickstarters by the parent category 'theatre' and examining their launch date by the month launched. This helped identify which months had the most successful kickstarters and thus which months would be best to launch in.

For further study we also filtered by the subcategory 'plays' and displayed how many funding goals came to fruition. This was categorized in increments of 5000 from 0 to 50000. Ultimately showing the the most successful funding goals were ultimately 5000 and less.

##Results

2 conclusions I can draw from the theatre outcomes by launch date is that the best month to launch a theatre kickstarter seems to be May and the worst month seems to be December. 

The 'Outcomes based on Goals' shows that the 'play' kickstarters with the highest success rate for funding their goal is '0-1000' and then 
'1001-5000'. Thus trying to keep the production under 5000 seems to have the highest chance of succeeding.

Some limitations on this dataset are that when examining kickstarters by the parent category 'theatres', you take into account not only plays but other options such as 'spaces' that can throw off the analysis and create outliers. Also this could be more specific and include not only that it's a play but also the genre to help identify which are most successful.

Other possibles tables and graphs to consider are 'Play' kickstarters by country to show which markets are the most successful for plays and backers by country for play kickstarters to help identify where the most generous backers are located
